This is a simple red-black tree implementation with no remotion, to compile run cpy on main.cpy
.in files are input files and .out are the respective outputs
The input is formated as:
O X
O being:
	1 = insertion of X
	2 = sucessor of X
	3 = predecessor of X
	4 = Query for tree's maximum value
	5 = Query for tree's minimum value
	6 = Pre order impression of all nodes
	7 = In order impression of all nodes
	8 = Post order impression of all nodes

This code was made as a concept test, compiled to C++, converted to C and used for other purpose than explaining, yet, you may get some usefull information from it.
